Keyboard layout mappings for Karabiner
========================================

[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
 is a powerful and stable keyboard customizer for OS X.
 

Motivation 
----------------------------------------
As a developer I prefer to use English keyboard layout.
But as lots of my colleagues used to German layout,
[pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) 
with two keyboards is hard to practice.

To lower the barriers for two-keyboard-setups, I've built this keyboard mapping.
It enables a German and English layout used simultaneously via Karabiner tool.
